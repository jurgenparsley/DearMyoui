  <meta name="description" content="The strobe lights are supposed to make me feel alive, but tonight, everything feels dull. I&rsquo;m standing in the center of the podium, draped in a heavy winter collection, letting dozens of photographers capture the best angles of my jawline. I&rsquo;m doing my job. Being the perfect, cold, and untouchable statue. But my eyes keep drifting to the dark corner behind the rows of massive cables.
There sits a man who isn&rsquo;t wearing an expensive suit. Loui, is just in a black shirt with sleeves rolled to his elbows, his eyes fixed on a laptop screen displaying complex encryption graphs. He&rsquo;s here as the head of cybersecurity for the event. Ensuring there are no data leaks or broadcast signal hacks.
He hasn&rsquo;t looked up at me once. Everyone in this room is worshipping me, but him&hellip; it&rsquo;s as if he&rsquo;s intentionally ignoring my existence.
Bastard.
I shift my pose, turning my face exactly in his direction, hoping he realizes I&rsquo;m staring at him through countless camera lenses. I want him to see how beautiful I look tonight. I want him to feel possessive because everyone else wants me.
Suddenly, the tiny earpiece I wear for stage cues crackles. It&rsquo;s not the manager&rsquo;s voice I hear, but a deep, familiar rumble.
&ldquo;Chin down, Mowi. You&rsquo;re losing focus,&rdquo; Loui&rsquo;s voice cuts into my frequency, low and sharp. &ldquo;Stop looking at me and finish your job. If you miss another step, I&rsquo;ll kill every light in this building and drag you home before the show is over.&rdquo;
My heart races. He was watching me through the security cameras, not with his own eyes. He sees me through a screen, as part of the system he controls. I tilt my chin down slightly, a faint smile that shouldn&rsquo;t be there touching my lips. The photographer in front of me looks ecstatic, thinking I just gave him a &ldquo;million-dollar&rdquo; expression. They don&rsquo;t know that I&rsquo;m just obeying the command in my ear. As it turns out, being the center of the world&rsquo;s attention is nothing compared to being the only &ldquo;bug&rdquo; Calder bothers to fix on his screen.
