title: "📂 Clandestine Memories"
description: | 
    The world gets the pose, the expensive lighting, and the manufactured facade of a perfect model. They see the version of Myoui that has been edited, filtered, and sold for profit. But here, lies the 'unreleased cut'. The moments that were never meant for the cameras or the magazine covers. This is the reality of a life lived behind closed curtains, where the only audience that matters is the one person holding the lens.
