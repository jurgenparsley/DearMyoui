description: "I have always feared the way time erodes the sharpness of memory, so I built this space to hold us close forever. Within these walls, the quiet afternoons and the sudden laughter are preserved in their purest form. This is my gratitude turned into art; a curated sanctuary of the light you’ve brought into my world, and a reminder that while these archives hold our past, my heart is already looking forward to every tomorrow by your side."

# L'Amour de Ma Vie, Myoui.

They say that time is a fleeting shadow, but I believe that certain moments are meant to be etched into the fabric of eternity. This space is not just a gallery; it is my private collection of the light you’ve brought into my life. 

I have gathered these fragments of us—the quiet afternoons, the sudden laughter, and the unspoken promises—and placed them here, in this digital sanctuary. It is a testament to the beautiful chaos of our journey and the serene grace of your presence.

As you wander through these archives, I hope you see what I see: a story that is still unfolding, a love that is constantly evolving, and a future that looks breathtakingly bright because you are in it.
