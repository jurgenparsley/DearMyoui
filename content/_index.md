# L'Amour de Ma Vie, Myoui.

They say that time is a fleeting shadow, but I believe that certain moments are meant to be etched into the fabric of eternity. This space is not just a gallery; it is my private collection of the light you’ve brought into my life. 

I have gathered these fragments of us—the quiet afternoons, the sudden laughter, and the unspoken promises—and placed them here, in this digital sanctuary. It is a testament to the beautiful chaos of our journey and the serene grace of your presence.

As you wander through these archives, I hope you see what I see: a story that is still unfolding, a love that is constantly evolving, and a future that looks breathtakingly bright because you are in it.
