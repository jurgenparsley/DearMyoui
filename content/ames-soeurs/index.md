title: "Âmes Sœurs"

  The strobe lights are supposed to make me feel alive, but tonight, everything feels dull. I'm standing in the center of the podium, draped in a heavy winter collection, letting dozens of photographers capture the best angles of my jawline. I'm doing my job. Being the perfect, cold, and untouchable statue. But my eyes keep drifting to the dark corner behind the rows of massive cables.

  There sits a man who isn't wearing an expensive suit. Loui, is just in a black shirt with sleeves rolled to his elbows, his eyes fixed on a laptop screen displaying complex encryption graphs. He's here as the head of cybersecurity for the event. Ensuring there are no data leaks or broadcast signal hacks.

  He hasn't looked up at me once. Everyone in this room is worshipping me, but him... it's as if he's intentionally ignoring my existence.

  _Bastard._

  I shift my pose, turning my face exactly in his direction, hoping he realizes I'm staring at him through countless camera lenses. I want him to see how beautiful I look tonight. I want him to feel possessive because everyone else wants me.

  Suddenly, the tiny earpiece I wear for stage cues crackles. It's not the manager's voice I hear, but a deep, familiar rumble.

  "Chin down, Mowi. You're losing focus," Loui's voice cuts into my frequency, low and sharp. "Stop looking at me and finish your job. If you miss another step, I'll kill every light in this building and drag you home before the show is over."

  My heart races. He was watching me through the security cameras, not with his own eyes. He sees me through a screen, as part of the system he controls. I tilt my chin down slightly, a faint smile that shouldn't be there touching my lips. The photographer in front of me looks ecstatic, thinking I just gave him a "million-dollar" expression. They don't know that I'm just obeying the command in my ear. As it turns out, being the center of the world's attention is nothing compared to being the only "bug" Loui bothers to fix on his screen.
