title: "Pour Toujours"
description: |
  My monitor displays thousands of lines of code that I'm supposed to finish tonight. But honestly, my concentration broke half an hour ago when I heard the key turn in the front door.

  It's Myoui.

  I don't turn around, intentionally staying focused on the screen so he doesn't know I've actually been waiting for him. Not long after, I feel arms wrap around my neck from behind. His floral perfume. A sharp contrast to my room that smells only of coffee, instantly fills my senses.

  "Not done yet?" he whispers, resting his chin on my shoulder. His voice sounds tired, but soft.

  "Almost, Sayang. There's one stubborn bug I've been chasing," I reply, trying to stay cool even though I can barely think straight with him leaning against me like this.

  Myoui doesn't protest. He doesn't ask me to shut down the laptop. Instead, he pulls an empty chair next to mine, sits down, and takes my right hand off the mouse to hold it. He starts telling me little things that happened at the shoot. About the catering being good, or a funny photographer.

  I keep looking at the screen, but my left hand is just typing gibberish now because I'd rather listen to his voice.

  "Are you even listening?" he asks, poking my nose.

  I finally rotate my chair, looking at him fully. He looks incredibly beautiful even with his makeup slightly faded. I brush a stray hair out of his eyes, then pull him closer, near enough that our knees touch.

  "I'm listening. To everything," I say softly. I take off my glasses, a sign that I'm officially giving up on work for the night. "After all, no matter how advanced the system I'm building is, nothing catches my attention quite like you when you're talking like this."

  Myoui smiles, the kind of genuine smile he never gives to the cameras. He leans his head on my shoulder, playing with my fingers.

  "Don't push yourself too hard. You'll get sick," he says caringly.

  I just chuckle softly and kiss the top of his head. "I know, I know. I'm done after this. Should we just order some food?"

  To the world, I might be the programmer who only cares about numbers and logic. But to Myoui, I'm just his Ludwig, the night owl who always has time to listen to his stories, no matter how trivial they are.
